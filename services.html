<h1>Reasons to live :</h1>

<h2>To prove the naysayers wrong:</h2>
<p>Sometimes a little spite is called for.
If anyone has ever questioned your ability or flat-out told you, “You’ll never
succeed at that,” it can be pretty satisfying to show them just how wrong they
are.</p>

<h2>The chance to find your people:</h2>
<p>It’s natural to feel lonely or isolated when there’s seemingly no one you can
relate to or share interests with.

If you haven’t met those people yet, it’s likely they’re out there somewhere and
they may be looking for you, too.</p>

<h2>Uncontrollable laughter:</h2>
<p>When was the last time you laughed until your stomach hurt and tears rolled
down your face? Chances are good there will be more of those times.
There’s a reason laughter feels great — research tells us it:</p>
<ul>
<li> reverses stress</li>
<li> stimulates endorphins</li>
<li> supports connection with others</li>
</ul>
If need be, consider faking it until you make it

<h2>That ‘spark’ from childhood</h2>
Remember that childhood feeling of being totally absorbed in what you’re doing?
You can invite that feeling of being completely, simply present back into your life.
Here’s one way to try:
<br>
<br>
Choose an activity that sounds like pure fun — not something you feel you should
want to do, but something you just want to do.
<br>
It might be frolicking in a park, creating a choreography, or planning a future
vacation.

Then set aside an hour or afternoon and allow yourself to get lost in the activity.

<h2>Nature</h2>

<p>Do you have a favorite spot to take in the beauty of nature?
Life on planet Earth can mean tropical beaches with aquamarine water,
panoramic views from hills and mountaintops, and serene forests full of fresh air.
Hey! And you’re part of it all.

<h2>Adrenaline</h2>

Pushing your limits and taking calculated risks might be your jam if you’re into
skydiving or roller coasters.
A small 2018 study emphasizes that adrenaline-boosting activities fostered
feelings of connection, happiness, and excitement in those who enjoyed them.

<h2>How to find your own reasons to keep going</h2>
<p>What motivates someone else might not work for you, and finding your own
motivation can be more difficult when you’re feeling low.</p>
<br>

“When we’re feeling low emotionally, our brains are less responsive to positive
stimuli, and more susceptible to detect and respond to negative stimuli, such as
negative thoughts about suicide or the meaninglessness of life,”
<br>
“My best advice for starting this process is to ask yourself: What would I be doing
if no one were watching? If I could do anything and had none of the limitations I
currently do... what would I be doing with my time?”
</p>


<h2>IF NOTHING WORKS :</h2>
<p>Look at this picture for a moment.
Only 1 out of 100,000,000 sperms fuses the ovum to conceive and unleash a new life.<br>
• You were born because you were the fittest and the strongest.<br>
• You outwitted close to 99.99 million other sperms to have been able to sit and read my answer.<br>
<br>

Life is not a piece of cake.
Things don’t turn out, as per expectations, every single time.
<br><br>
But, whenever you feel that there is no purpose left to this beautiful and vibrant life, take a moment
to look at this picture.
You were capable the day even when you didn’t realize it.
If you could outshine others then, you can do it again.</p>
